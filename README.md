release suitable for your system.

## Usage Guide

See the [documentation](http://sgpt.readthedocs.io/) for detailed usage instructions.

### Getting started: Obtaining an OpenAI API Key

To use the OpenAI API, you must first obtain an API key.

1. Visit [https://platform.openai.com/overview](https://platform.openai.com/overview) and sign up for an account.
2. Navigate to [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and generate
   a new API key.
3. On Linux or macOS: Update your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to include the following export statement adding your API
   key as the value:

  ```shell
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
  ```

1. On Windows: [Update your environment variables](https://geekflare.com/system-environment-variables-in-windows/) to
   include the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable with your API key as the value.

After completing these steps, you'll have an OpenAI API key that can be used to interact with the OpenAI models through
the SGPT tool.

**Note:** Your API key is sensitive information. Do not share it with anyone.

### Querying OpenAI Models

SGPT allows you to ask simple questions and receive informative answers. For example:

```shell
$ sgpt "mass of sun"
The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kilograms.
```

You can also pass prompts to SGPT using pipes:

```shell
$ echo -n "mass of sun" | sgpt
The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kilograms.
```

If you want to stream the completion to the command line, you can add the `--stream` flag. This will stream the output
to the command line as it is generated.

### GPT-4 Vision API

SGPT additionally facilitates the utilization of the GPT-4 Vision API. Include input images using the `-i` or `--input`
flag, supporting both URLs and local images.

```shell
$ sgpt -m "gpt-4-vision-preview" -i "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Marvin_%28HHGG%29.jpg" "what can you see on the picture?"
The image shows a figure resembling a robot with a humanoid form. It has a
$ sgpt -m "gpt-4-vision-preview" -i pkg/fs/testdata/marvin.jpg "what can you see on the picture?"
The image shows a figure resembling a robot with a sleek, metallic surface. It
```

It is also possible to combine URLs and local images:

```shell
$ sgpt -m "gpt-4-vision-preview" -i "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Marvin_%28HHGG%29.jpg" -i pkg/fs/testdata/marvin.jpg "what is the difference between those two pictures"
The two images provided appear to be identical. Both show the same depiction of a
```

To avoid specifying the `-m "gpt-4-vision-preview"` for each request, you can streamline the process by creating a bash
alias:

```shell
alias vision='sgpt -m "gpt-4-vision-preview"'
```

For more bash examples, see [.bashrc](https://github.com/tbckr/sgpt/blob/main/.bashrc).

**Important:** The GPT-4-vision API integration is currently in beta and may change in the future.

### Chat Capabilities

SGPT provides chat functionality that enables interactive conversations with OpenAI models. You can use the `--chat`
flag to initiate and reference chat sessions.

The chat capabilities allow you to interact with OpenAI models in a more dynamic and engaging way, making it
easier to obtain relevant responses, code, or shell commands through continuous conversations.

The example below demonstrates how to fine-tune the model's responses for more targeted outcomes.

1. The first command initiates a chat session named `ls-files` and asks the model to "list all files directory":

  ```shell
  $ sgpt sh --chat ls-files "list all files directory"
  ls
  ```

1. The second command continues the conversation within the `ls-files` chat session and requests to "sort by name":

  ```shell
  $ sgpt sh --chat ls-files "sort by name"
  ls | sort
  ```

The model provides the appropriate shell command `ls | sort`, which lists all files in a directory and sorts them by
name.

### Generating and Executing Shell Commands

SGPT can generate shell commands based on your input:

```shell
$ sgpt sh "make all files in current directory read only"
chmod -R 444 *
```

You can also generate a shell command and execute it directly:

```shell
$ sgpt sh --execute "make all files in current directory read only"
chmod -R 444 *
Do you want to execute this command? (Y/n) y
```

The `sh` command is a default persona to generate shell commands. For more information on personas, see
the [docs](https://sgpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/personas/).

### Interactive Shell Sessions

Currently, SGPT does not support interactive shell sessions. However, `rlwrap` can be used to enable
interactive-like shell sessions ([source](https://github.com/tbckr/sgpt/issues/111#issuecomment-1869814041)):

```text
$ rlwrap bash -c 'echo ▶; while read in; do [[ -n "$in" ]] && echo ■ && sgpt --chat chat_name "$in" && echo ▶; done'
▶
mass of sun
■
The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kilograms, or about 330,000 times the mass of Earth. It contains about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System and is by far the most dominant object in it. The Sun's mass is composed mostly of hydrogen (~74%) and helium (~24%), with the remaining 2% consisting of heavier elements.
▶
convert to earth masses
■
To convert the mass of the Sun to Earth masses, you can simply divide the Sun's mass by the mass of the Earth. Given that:


A. The Sun's mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kilograms.

B. The Earth's mass is approximately 5.972 x 10^24 kilograms.

Using these values, you can calculate how many Earth masses the Sun is:

(1.989 x 10^30 kg) / (5.972 x 10^24 kg/Earth) = approximately 333,000 Earth masses

So the Sun is about 333,000 times more massive than the Earth.
▶
```

A script with automated session name generation and notification support could look like this:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

shopt -s -o errexit
shopt -s -o pipefail
shopt -s -o nounset
shopt -s inherit_errexit

export CHAT="$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S%3N')_$(tr -dc 'A-Za-z' </dev/urandom | head -c 3)"
rlwrap bash -c 'echo ▶; while read in; do [[ -n "$in" ]] && echo ■ && sgpt --chat "$CHAT" "$in" && echo ▶ && notify-send --urgency=low 💬 ; done'
```

Thanks to @ilya-bystrov for coming up with this solution.

### Code Generation Capabilities

SGPT can efficiently generate code based on given instructions. For instance, to solve the classic FizzBuzz problem
using Python, simply provide the prompt as follows:

```shell
$ sgpt code "Solve classic fizz buzz problem using Python"
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```

SGPT will return the appropriate Python code to address the FizzBuzz problem.

The `code` command is a default persona to generate code. For more information on personas, see
the [docs](https://sgpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/personas/).

### Enhancing Your Workflow with Bash Aliases and Functions

SGPT can be further integrated into your workflow by creating bash aliases and functions. This enables you to automate
common tasks and improve efficiency when working with OpenAI models and shell commands.

Indeed, you can configure SGPT to generate your git commit message using the following bash function:

```shell
gsum() {
  commit_message="$(sgpt txt "Generate git commit message, my changes: $(git diff)")"
  printf "%s\n" "$commit_message"
  read -rp "Do you want to commit your changes with this commit message? [y/N] " response
  if [[ $response =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    git add . && git commit -m "$commit_message"
  else
    echo "Commit cancelled."
  fi
}
```

For instance, the commit message for this description and bash function would appear as follows:

```shell
$ gsum
feat: Add bash function to generate git commit messages

Added `gsum()` function to `.bash_aliases` that generates a commit message using sgpt to summarize git changes.
The user is prompted to confirm the commit message before executing `git add . && git commit -m "<commit_message>"`.
This function is meant to automate the commit process and increase productivity in daily work.

Additionally, updated the README.md file to include information about the new bash function and added a section to
showcase useful bash aliases and functions found in `.bash_aliases`.
Do you want to commit your changes with this commit message? [y/N] y
[main d6db80a] feat: Add bash function to generate git commit messages
 2 files changed, 48 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .bash_aliases
```

A compilation of beneficial bash aliases and functions, including an updated gsum function, is available
in [.bashrc](.bashrc).
