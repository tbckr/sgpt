## Ask Questions

SGPT allows you to ask simple questions and receive informative answers. For example:

```shell
$ sgpt "mass of sun"
The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kilograms.
```

You can also pass prompts to SGPT using pipes:

```shell
$ echo -n "mass of sun" | sgpt
The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kilograms.
```

## Generate Code

SGPT can efficiently generate code based on given instructions. For instance, to solve the classic FizzBuzz problem
using Python, simply provide the prompt as follows:

```shell
$ sgpt code "Solve classic fizz buzz problem using Python"
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```

SGPT will return the appropriate Python code to address the FizzBuzz problem.

## Generate and Execute Shell Commands

SGPT can generate shell commands based on your input:

```shell
$ sgpt sh "make all files in current directory read only"
chmod -R 444 *
```

You can also generate a shell command and execute it directly:

```shell
$ sgpt sh --execute "make all files in current directory read only"
chmod -R 444 *
Do you want to execute this command? (Y/n) y
```
