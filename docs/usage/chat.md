# Chat Capabilities

SGPT provides chat functionality that enables interactive conversations with OpenAI models. You can use the `--chat`
flag with the `txt`, `sh`, and `code` subcommands to initiate and reference chat sessions.

The chat capabilities allow you to interact with OpenAI models in a more dynamic and engaging way, making it
easier to obtain relevant responses, code, or shell commands through continuous conversations.

The example below demonstrates how to fine-tune the model's responses for more targeted outcomes.

1. The first command initiates a chat session named `ls-files` and asks the model to "list all files directory":

```shell
$ sgpt sh --chat ls-files "list all files directory"
ls
```

1. The second command continues the conversation within the `ls-files` chat session and requests to "sort by name":

```shell
$ sgpt sh --chat ls-files "sort by name"
ls | sort
```

The model provides the appropriate shell command `ls | sort`, which lists all files in a directory and sorts them by
name.

To manage active chat sessions, use the `sgpt chat` command. Here are the available options for chat session management:

- `sgpt chat ls`: List all active chat sessions.
- `sgpt chat show <chat session>`: Display the content of a specific chat session.
- `sgpt chat rm <chat session>`: Remove a chat session.
- `sgpt chat rm --all`: Delete all chat sessions.
